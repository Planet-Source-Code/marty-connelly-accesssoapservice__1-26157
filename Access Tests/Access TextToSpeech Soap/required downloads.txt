 Soap Web Services called Talking Clock, Text to Speech (returns .wav
file so MS XVoice.dll not required) make your error messages verbal,
Airline Plane location while plane in the air, Text language translation
English to Spanish etc., California Highway conditions,
Worldwide SMS phone messages (SMS requires free registration)

 The code in here is not pretty and is just meant to get you
up and running against Soap Web Services. The problem I had was in not 
being able to tell whether the services I was running against was 
either available or configured correctly in the Soap Server. At least 
some of these should work. You may have to change some file paths 
and references (ie. delete MS xvoice.dll if you haven't installed)
Have fun and I hope this is enough to give you some ideas. I haven't
seen any code to do this on planet source so it is just a first shot.
To try sample service examples at least 50 go to 
http://www.xmethods.net
There is a uddi interface at this site here so you could get your 
program to search the uddi site and execute the service after doing
a discovery on the t-model and wsdl.

 You will have to read some of soap articles listed below to gain
a fuller understanding of Soap or it's cousin XML-RPC.
You will need PocketSoap Toolkit to run this code.

 This code has a lot of dead code mostly left in to show some of 
the dead ends I tried. I don't use WSDL but you could code in with
MS Soap toolkit ver 2.0 beta 2. I just look up the SoapAction URI's
in the WSDL file and code in proxy and parameters. For more info go
to the Soap Web Service Sites listed below. The talking clock shows
how to use base64 coding in XML.

 Some of the Soap Servers go up and down at odd intervals, so you
might retry at a later time or date.

 I used simon Fell's PocketSoap as it works on Win CE or Palms as 
well as Win95 since MS Soap Toolkit utilitzes some OS calls only 
available in Win98 and higher. There are other toolkits available 
such as SoapLite. The toolkits reduce the amount of code required
to parse the Soap Envelope and XML serializers. It also points
and sends the Soap XML envelope to the proper URL endpoint.

Downloads necessary

 or use Microsoft Soap toolkit must be Win98 or above
